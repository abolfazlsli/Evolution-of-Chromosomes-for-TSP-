### Evolution of Chromosomes for TSP 🧬📍  

This project visualizes the evolution of a population of chromosomes in a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for solving the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. The algorithm simulates different generations of solutions, showing how the order of cities evolves over time.

---

## 📌 Overview  
The visualization represents chromosomes (routes) across multiple generations, illustrating how they improve or change. Each chromosome is depicted as a sequence of cities, with transitions between them.

## 📊 Features  
✅ **Visual Representation:** Each chromosome is displayed using circular nodes connected by edges.  
✅ **Multi-Generation Display:** Tracks the evolution of solutions across different generations.  
✅ **Clear Annotations:** Labels for each generation to understand the progression.

## 🚀 How to Run  
1️⃣ Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tsp-genetic-visualization.git
cd tsp-genetic-visualization
```
2️⃣ Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
3️⃣ Run the script:  
```bash
python tsp_visualization.py
```

---

## 🔍 Example Output  
When executed, the script generates a visual representation of how the chromosomes evolve, like this:

```
Initial Population    →   Generation 1    →   Generation 2    →   Generation 3
   (Routes)               (Improved)          (Optimized)         (Final Set)
```
